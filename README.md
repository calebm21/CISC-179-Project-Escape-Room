# CISC-179-Project: Escape Room

The goal of this project is to be like a virtual escape room.

Users are asked to input their character name.
They are given a number of choices from a list, like how people test everything inside an escape room in real life.
Each choice contains either nothing, a hint, or a keyword.

To escape, the "door" requires 3 passwords. 
If even one password is wrong, the "locks" reset and the user must choose an option again.

The program essentially runs on a while loop that lasts until the "door" is unlocked.

Implemented course concepts: input/interaction, if/else statements, while loops, nested loops, functions
